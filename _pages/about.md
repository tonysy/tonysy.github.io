I am a Young Scientist of [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), collaborate with [Dr. Kai Chen](https://chenkai.site/). Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher, supervised by [Prof. Dahua Lin](http://dahua.me/). Currently, I lead a team working on foundation model, includes the research and open-source platform. My team intiates the  [**OpenCompass**](https://opencompass.org.cn/) project, an evaluation platform for foundation model. My team also contributes to the [**InternLM**](https://internlm.com/) project, working on the research and open-source of large language model/vision-language model.
We also developed OpenMMLab projects [**MMPreTrain**](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpretrain).
